// Changer is an API that can be used by a raft server to change its
// membership in a cluster (i.e. either join it or leave it).
//
// It works by using some transport layer (e.g. HTTP, TCP, etc) to
// send a membership change request to a target server that is part of
// the cluster and that can handle such requests, possibly redirecting
// the requesting server to another server (e.g. the cluster leader).
//
// It is effectively an extensions of the raft.Transport interface,
// with additional semantics for joining/leaving a raft cluster.
